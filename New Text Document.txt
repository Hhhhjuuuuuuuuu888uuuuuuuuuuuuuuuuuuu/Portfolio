Hi, I'm Collins Mailula.

I'm an Environmental Science student with a strong interest in maps, data, and digital tools. I enjoy creating personal projects that blend environmental knowledge with technology — especially using tools like GIS, HTML, and CSS. Whether it's building simple websites, analyzing spatial data, or visualizing maps, I’m always exploring new ways to connect what I learn with real-world applications.

This portfolio is a space where I share some of the self-initiated projects I've worked on to build my skills and challenge myself. Feel free to explore and see what I’ve been creating!

About Me
My name is Collins Mailula, and I’m currently studying Environmental Science at Tshwane University of Technology. I enjoy building self-driven projects that allow me to apply what I learn in creative and practical ways. This portfolio is a collection of some of those projects — ideas I’ve brought to life through curiosity, dedication, and a love for learning.

My skillset includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an understanding of environmental concepts. I’m constantly looking for ways to grow, improve, and explore how science and technology can work together to create positive change.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
