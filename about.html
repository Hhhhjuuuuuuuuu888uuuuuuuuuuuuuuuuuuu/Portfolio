    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h5>My name is Collins Mailula, and I’m currently studying
         Environmental Science at Tshwane University of Technology.
          I enjoy building self-driven projects that allow me to apply
           what I learn in creative and practical ways. This portfolio
            is a collection of some of those projects — ideas I’ve brought 
            to life through curiosity, dedication, and a love for learning.

         My skillset includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an understanding 
          of environmental concepts. I’m constantly looking for ways to grow,
            improve, and explore how science and technology can work together to 
            create positive change.

           Thanks for stopping by — I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
